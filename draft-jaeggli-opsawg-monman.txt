1.  Introduction

   In order to understand the environmnent network managment and
   measurement work in the IETF is developed in it is important to have
   an understanding of the pressures on and preferences of the IETF
   community.  It is also important to look at the historical milestones
   in the history of manangement and measurement protocol work and
   network instrumentation generally.  Finally with that in mind we can
   describe the problems that future work will face along with places
   where points of contention are we believe evasive to consensus.

   The authors, began this work by asking if monitoring and measrurement
   work previously chartered in the IETF (example IPFIX, or previously
   Netflow, AAA, Syslog, or VOIP CDR) could be chartered today after RFC
   7258 (Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack).  The answer is probably yes
   but the questions is insufficiently nuanced.  Future work informed by
   RFC 7285 on the on those previously mentioned areas as well as DNS,
   P2P networking, the HTTP protocol and lower layer IPv4/IPv6 and
   transport evolution may contribute to decreased surface area for
   pervasive monitoring, but if it also contributes to a decline in the
   managability of networks and services or exposes opertors to new
   forms of attack those are also considerations we should be mindful
   off.

2.  Background

   So long as IP netorks have existed, it has been necessary to carry
   information about topology (routing), manage the various network
   elements, facilitate diagnostics, and carry actual user traffic.  For
   only a slightly shorter period of time, IP networks have been under
   attack, variously due to threats of availability, autheticity and
   access, integreity, and capture/reuse/replability.

2.1.  Pervasive Monitoring

   The revelations present the Edward Snowden Whistle Blowing case were
   a capstone event in the long-standing efforts by state and non-state
   actors to peer into all aspects of internet communications as an
   extension of state control, law enforcement and miltary capabilites.
   the consequence of the developmnet of such capabilities is to subvert
   the integretigty of persional communitie

      IETF standards already provide mechanisms to protect Internet
      communications and there are guidelines RFC 3552 [RFC3552] for
      applying these in protocol design.  But those standards generally
      do not address PM, the confidentiality of protocol metadata,
      countering traffic analysis, or data minimisation.  In all cases,
      there will remain some privacy-relevant information that is
      inevitably disclosed by protocols.  As technology advances,
      techniques that were once only available to extremely well-funded
      actors become more widely accessible.  Mitigating PM is therefore
      a protection against a wide range of similar attacks.  RFC 7258
      [RFC7258]

   The recomendations in RFC 7258 for working on mitigation purposely
   avoid targeting network monitoring and management.

      While PM is an attack, other forms of monitoring that might fit
      the definition of PM can be beneficial and not part of any attack,
      e.g., network management functions monitor packets or flows and
      anti-spam mechanisms need to see mail message content.  Some
      monitoring can even be part of the mitigation for PM, for example,
      certificate transparency [RFC6962] involves monitoring Public Key
      Infrastructure in ways that could detect some PM attack
      techniques.  However, there is clear potential for monitoring
      mechanisms to be abused for PM, so this tension needs careful
      consideration in protocol design.

2.2.  Integrity and availablity

2.3.  Managability Considerations

2.3.1.  MIBs and Data-models

   We have security considerations for MIB module security
   [MIB-SECURITY] as well as Yang data models [YANG-SECURITY] where we
   highlight what may be considered sensitive information as well as
   handling recomendations.

   However it seems that review with an eye towards privicy
   considerations seems to want over time to impose to impose strictered
   and stricter considerations on their usage.

   it should be recognized from the outset that it is necessary for
   management systems to be exposed to and collect information necessary
   to their opperation, which may include host or user specific unique
   identifiers, credentials for mutual authetication, the state
   andconfiguration of devices and so on.

2.3.2.  Security Considerations

   the collection of data which is necessarily PII is part of operating
   a service for a customer, and protecting services and customers from
   abuse.

3.  Protocol interactions with PM and Security Considerations

3.1.  IPFIX and flow monitoring generall and associated security
      considerations

   Contratary to some popularized expectations, the migration of
   applications towards a general prefence towards port 80 and 443 and
   as has not rendered ipflow export less useful for ASPs or ISPs
   looking to monitor their traffic for usage patterns, performance,
   growth protection or abuse detection.  Source and Destinations,
   connection establishment are all present. from the vantage-point of
   an application provider the applications tend to be well understood,
   so sampled ipfix even with limited metadata (such as ingress por and
   router) can reveal abuntdant information about how customers reach
   and use a service, when it is being attacked and so on.

   Likewise while, at first glance a internet service providers' flow
   export might appear t o a be a poorly differentiated sample flows
   from their customers to their other costumers and peers, the
   concentration of applications under the ruberic of a few thousand

   realtively large and well understood application providers makes the
   nature of many such flows fairly straight forward to chracterize.

   This template was derived from an initial version written by Pekka
   Savola and contributed by him to the xml2rfc project.

   This document is part of a plan to make xml2rfc indispensable
   [DOMINATION].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   the update of RFC 2434 [I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis]
   for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do anything, the
   section contains an explicit statement that this is the case (as
   above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section will be
   removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.

6.  Security Considerations

   All drafts are required to have a security considerations section.
   See RFC 3552 [RFC3552] for a guide.
