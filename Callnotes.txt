Call notes
On the the subject of network monitoring and management in a hostile world

pervasive monitoring

operating networking

     carrying around  information that is necessary not moreso

The ietf giving a shit about monitoring management and operations

pervasive monitoring is an attack

     not just on end users and their data

     network operators and application service providers are also targets

     the viability of many businesses is subverted by the exfiltration of information (security threats)

     at the same time  operators, especially those running enough  need to be able to monitor classify and manage data traversing their endpoints or landing on their networks

     could management/monitoring work previously done in the IETF be done today?

          netflow / ipfix

          protocol work (1588, dhcp, IPv6 ND)

          mac addresses as identity / key value

          information leakage on the wire (routing protocols) data collection protocols

          security review blinders

               value of the data to an attacker

               whether it should collected at all

                    whether it can be collected some other way or is already exposed

               whether it’s pii or not

                    data sanitation

waist in the hourglass moving.

     weeding out unnecessary information

We have security guidelines for MIB modules and YANG data models, where we highlight the sensitive information.

    https://trac.tools.ietf.org/area/ops/trac/wiki/yang-security-guidelines
However, it seems that privacy wants to impose stricter and stricter rules

On one side, we have privacy for end user. There is witch hunt for every privacy aspects.
On the other side, we have:
    operational aspects
    regulatory rules around data retention that demand CDR

PII for the operator, regarding their paying customers is perfectly fine.

One important aspect: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mm-wg-effect-encrypt-03
    I haven't read it yet

Deborah: Operators are not evil

My views:

    - If for sacrosanct quest of privacy at all costs, I have no way to manage networks, I will have a serious problem with the IESG.
    From time to time, I will ask this question to the IESG: if we would start the IPFIX effort at the IETF now, would it be blocked because of RFC7528? If the answer is yes, and there are no alternatives, I would have a serious problem with the IESG.

--------


reflexive attempt to hide all information - little 

data retention laws 

tor - for example hard

witch hunt to hide every single user - userinterface issues around traffic bound for different destinations - 

should not be defined as a threat model for the existance of ops

use cases for existance of DPI.

varying difference  of  definition of dpi

We might have to standardize ToR:
    Difficult to differentiate between service and protocol
    Opportunistic tunneling consideration, like 6to4 or teredo
    ...

Private email from Mirja:

    Btw. I very much agree to your comment/question on which part of work would not have happen, would we have applied this earlier. I think it’s a bad attribute, not to say misuse, to use this security/privacy card to stop work in its infancy instead of trying to improve the work that is on-going… (I might bring this up later depending on where this goes.)

different audience for privacy 

what is the outcome of having two ops ads working on this

we want to manage networks

the users want privacy - but also the necessary exposure

our own reflection regarding the future of oops and what the ietf should do

differing sets of concerns annd needs

endpoint provider
isp
enduser
managed service provider
enterprise
