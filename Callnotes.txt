On the the subject of network monitoring and management in a hostile world

pervasive monitoring

operating networking

     carrying around  information that is necessary not moreso

The ietf giving a shit about monitoring management and operations

pervasive monitoring is an attack

     not just on end users and their data

     network operators and application service providers are also targets

     the viability of many businesses is subverted by the exfiltration of information (security threats)

     at the same time  operators, especially those running enough  need to be able to monitor classify and manage data traversing their endpoints or landing on their networks

     could management/monitoring work previously done in the IETF be done today?

          netflow / ipfix

          protocol work (1588, dhcp, IPv6 ND)

          mac addresses as identity / key value

          information leakage on the wire (routing protocols) data collection protocols

          security review blinders

               value of the data to an attacker

               whether it should collected at all

                    whether it can be collected some other way or is already exposed

               whether itâ€™s pii or not

                    data sanitation

waist in the hourglass moving.

     weeding out unnecessary information
