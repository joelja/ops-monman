    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
      In order to understand the environmnent network managment and measurement work in the IETF is developed in it is important to have an understanding of the pressures on and preferences of the IETF community. It is also important to look at the historical milestones in the history of manangement and measurement protocol work and network instrumentation generally. Finally with that in mind we can describe the problems that future work will face along with places where points of contention are we believe evasive to consensus.
      </t>

      <t>
      The authors, began this work by asking if monitoring and measrurement work previously chartered in the IETF (example IPFIX, or previously Netflow, AAA,  Syslog, or VOIP CDR) could be chartered today after RFC 7258  (Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack). The answer is probably yes but the questions is insufficiently nuanced. Future work informed by RFC 7285 on the on those previously mentioned areas as well as DNS, P2P networking, the HTTP protocol and lower layer IPv4/IPv6 and transport evolution may contribute to decreased surface area for pervasive monitoring, but if it also contributes to a decline in the managability of networks and services or exposes opertors to new forms of  attack those are also considerations we should be mindful off. 
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Background">
    <t>
      So long as IP netorks have existed, it has been necessary to carry information about topology (routing), manage the various network elements, facilitate diagnostics, and carry actual user traffic. For only a slightly shorter period of time, IP networks have been under attack, variously due to threats of availability, autheticity and access, integreity, and capture/reuse/replability.</t>

      <section title="Pervasive Monitoring">
        <t>The revelations present  the Edward Snowden Whistle Blowing case were a capstone event in the long-standing efforts by state and non-state actors to peer into all aspects of internet communications as an extension of state control, law enforcement and miltary capabilites. the consequence of the developmnet of such capabilities is to subvert the integretigty of persional communitie</t> 
        
        <t>
        <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
          <t>
        IETF standards already provide mechanisms to protect Internet communications and there are guidelines  <xref
        target="RFC3552">RFC 3552</xref> for applying these in protocol design.  But those standards generally do not address PM, the confidentiality of protocol metadata, countering traffic    analysis, or data minimisation.  In all cases, there will remain some privacy-relevant information that is inevitably disclosed by    protocols.  As technology advances, techniques that were once only available to extremely well-funded actors become more widely    accessible.  Mitigating PM is therefore a protection against a wide range of similar attacks.   <xref target="RFC7258">RFC 7258</xref></t>
      </list>
        </t>

        <t>
        The recomendations in RFC 7258 for working on mitigation purposely avoid targeting network monitoring and management.
        </t>

        <t>
        <list hangIndent="10" style="empty">
          <t>
             While PM is an attack, other forms of monitoring that might fit the
   definition of PM can be beneficial and not part of any attack, e.g.,
   network management functions monitor packets or flows and anti-spam
   mechanisms need to see mail message content.  Some monitoring can
   even be part of the mitigation for PM, for example, certificate
   transparency [RFC6962] involves monitoring Public Key Infrastructure
   in ways that could detect some PM attack techniques.  However, there
   is clear potential for monitoring mechanisms to be abused for PM, so
   this tension needs careful consideration in protocol design.

          We have security considerations for <xref

        target="YANG-SECURITY">Yang data models</xref> where we highlight what may be considered sensitive information as well as handling recomendations.</t>

           <t>However it seems that review with an eye towards privicy considerations seems to want over time to impose to impose strictered and stricter considerations on their usage. 
          </t>

          <t>it should be recognized from the outset that it is necessary for management systems to be exposed to and collect information necessary to their opperation, which may include host or user specific unique identifiers, credentials for mutual authetication, the state andconfiguration of devices and so on.</t>

      <section title="IPFIX and flow monitoring generall and associated security considerations">
        <t>
        Contratary to some popularized expectations, the migration of applications towards a general prefence towards port 80 and 443 and as has not rendered ipflow export less useful for  ASPs or ISPs looking to monitor their traffic for usage patterns, performance, growth protection or abuse detection. Source and Destinations, connection establishment are all present. from the vantage-point of an application provider the applications tend to be well understood, so sampled ipfix even with limited metadata (such as ingress por and router) can reveal abuntdant information about how customers reach and use a service, when it is being attacked and so on.
        </t>
        <t>
        Likewise while, at first glance a internet service providers' flow export might appear t o a be a poorly differentiated sample flows from their customers to their other costumers and peers, the concentration of applications under the ruberic of a few thousand realtively large and well understood application providers makes the nature of many such flows fairly straight forward to chracterize.

                      other minor corrections
v03 2007-03-09  EBD   Added comments on null IANA sections and fixed heading capitalization.
                      Modified comments around figure to reflect non-implementation of
                      figure indent control.  Put in reference using anchor="DOMINATION".
                      Fixed up the date specification comments to reflect current truth.
v04 2007-03-09 AH     Major changes: shortened discussion of PIs,
                      added discussion of rfc include.
v05 2007-03-10 EBD    Added preamble to C program example to tell about ABNF and alternative 
                      images. Removed meta-characters from comments (causes problems).  -->
